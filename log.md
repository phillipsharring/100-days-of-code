# 100 Days Of Code - Log

<!--
### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: 10 December 2019, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I figured out what was wonky w/ the route model binding in API routes. I fleshed out some basic endpoints for the orgs. There's index, store, show & update now. I also debugged and finished the add-employee endpoint.

**Thoughts** I didn't realize Route::bind _doesn't work at all_ w/o the SubstituteBindings middleware. My band unexpectedly kicked me out, so maybe this is a good time to have 100 days of code in my life, too :) Going to try and figure out if there's any way I can share code from what I'm working on when it's the proprietary hustle thing.

### Day 2: 11 December 2019, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I extended the basic User class in App\User into App\Models\Employee, moved all of the custom relationships from App\User to App\Model\Employee, and updated any reference to App\User to App\Models\Employee in the relationships in other Models. Tweaked the relationship functions inside Employee so they work (since some key assumptions changed now that the class name changed; and some were just plain wrong). Made an endpoint for employees/{id}/reports to post a new report along w/ the Request, Dto & Action.

**Thoughts** It's weird how Larave's compound routes something/{id}/child get named automatically, or I'm doing it wrong (likely), but it's appending the ".child" and leaving out the "something." But if you add 'as' => 'something.child' then it ends up 'something.child.child' so you just have to say 'as' => 'something,' which is somewhat unintuitive.

### Day 3: 12 December 2019, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Worked day job until the afternoon, then me and the soon-to-be mrs. got dolled up and drove the 3 hours to Charlotte for the day job company holiday party. Was a success. Grabbed dinner. Headed back the 3 hours. Got in around 1:40 and to sleep by about 2am. Upshot: missed today.

### Day 4: 13 December 2019, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Super "jet lagged" from being up til 2 last night and back at work this morning. I created one and a half end-points. One for 'set manager' (the inverse of 'add report') and started work on 'create thought' endpoint, which will have some moving parts due to the multiple models that are rouched. Went almost an hour. Pooped out. Brain tracks could not hold trains of thought...

**Thoughts** Very few at the moment :)

### Day 5: 14 December 2019, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Finished 'create thought'. Did 'add verison of thought' end point.

**Thoughts** If we added demographics to "employees" in this thing, we could run queries like breakdowns of problems validated/rejected, positive/negative feedback, etc. by the demographics. Wondering how to make that work. If it should be optional or what. Definitely should be invisible in the interface except to the user filling out the demographic info and in the aggregate data. Could be an interesting tool for some conversations.

### Day 6: 15 December 2019, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Finished 'add version of thought'. Completed 'Add development to thought'. Realized the model/code for adding a development assumed the "sender" would always be who created the thought and fixed that.

**Thoughts** Realized I didn't need a couple of the endpoints I had in my list. Don't need 'send thought' - because it's basically an alias of 'send development on thought,' and I don't need 'add verion of element' because that's handled in 'add version of thought...' Nice to not have to do those, but I want to go through the UI docs and see if I'm missing API endpoints. Had some innter turmoil about having the 'add a development' endpoint be just POST developments OR POST thoughts/{thought id}/developments and went with the latter because that URL space can have a few other HTTP verbs on it for stuff we'll need, like a list of developments on a given thought.

### Day 7 though 9: 15 December 2019, Sunday ... 27 December 2019 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on stuff 3 days out of this entire time period. Blew the challenge. Going to keep going, keep working, keep logging anyway.

Day 7: Went back over documentation to find statuses and created state classes for them. Looked at doing transitions. Read the code for @spatie_beâ€˜s state & transition package. Went down a 'maybe I should be a product manager' rabbit hole...

Day 8: Did something stupid and lost all my model files. Ouch. Looked into doing recovery. Fn00b stepped in when I was tearing my hair out and helped out. She found slightly old by a few days versions of them. Definitely lost some stuff, but couldn't at the time figure out what it was.

Many days pass here... Depression... Got kicked out of band... Holidays... etc.

Day 9: Returned to working on stuff. Wrote a tweet about getting back on the horse, but it sounded like a pity party, so I deleted it. The upshot is I'm going to keep going despite missing days and too bad if people don't like it. It's not our failures that define us, it's how quickly we pick our selves up and keep going. This was a major drop that I hope to not repeat.

**Thoughts** Too numerous to mention.

**Link(s) to work\*\* No**

More days pass here... Getting past the depression... Found a new band...

### What I'm Calling Day 10: 5 January 2020, Satruday

Did my first CTF... Lots of problem solving. Writing scripts in Powershell which I've never done.

### Day 11: 6 January 2020, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Re-ran my seeders and my requests that were saved in Postman and discovered some of the things that I lost when the model files got rolled back. Re-created most of it. Continued to work. Added a few more endpoints. Fixed a bunch of little things that I disovered through testing. Cleaned up the Seed data and the Postman requests so they kind of compliment each other. Postman stuff picks up where they seeds leave off.

Unrelated to that project, I was looking around in GitHub and found a weird pull request. It's from their Dependabot. Notified me of some security vulnerabilities and outdated versions. Pretty neat. Merged one and resolved the other myself.

**Thoughts** Was frustrated by having to recreate stuff, which is part of what I was depressed about up there... but I think I'm past that now and back to where I was and then some. Yeah, I missed more days in there. But I'm just going to go forward and count the next day when I get to it. I'm still shooting to get to 100 and I'm still going to try and do them consecutively. I have an intense urge to finish this dang thing and put it in front of people. Maybe it could be a product and I could quit the old day job eventually. I love where I'm working now, but I don't want to be at the whims of an employer any longer than necessary. I feel like for the work I've been doing I haven't made a lot of visible progress, since it's all API, which makes it feel like I'm not really accomplishing anything... but I know I am, and it will pay off when putting the front-end together. Just keep swimming...

## 2020... Kind of a blur

**Progress**: At least 200+ days of code at the day job in here. I wish I could say 50 good days of side hustle coding, but I don't think that's true, sadly. 30, maybe? Made slow, slow progress on that front. Was shooting for a working demo by April... annnd I'm still working on that. Got a new job in August, which was a _HUGE_ relief. Have really been challenged and grown as a developer since starting there. Got _way_ into containers. Got deeper into front-end. Learned some basic ReactJS. Got deeper into Symfony. Started seriously on AppSec w/ some books, esp. at Christmas time. Got _really_ into containers and finally grocked it. Basically I've stopped using Laragon all together.

**Thoughts**: I mean, The Pandemic, am I right? Still hate Doctrine with a blind passion. Rough year. Got through it. Got married along the way, yay!

## 2021

**Progress this year so far**: Finally figured out WSL, docker on WSL, and all that jazz. Loving it. Loving it loving it loving it. Will never go back. Fell out of love w/ InertiaJS and TailwindCSS (sorry, folks!) Learned NuxtJS. Been using it to revamp the side hustle and my personal site. Launched the personal site, hooray! Went back to having a separate front-end and a _real_ API for the side project. So, obviously, I'm leaving out a _lot_ of detail here, but that kind of brings us up to...

Day...? I don't know? Let's call it... (checks notes) 12?!

### Day 12: 23 February 2021, Tuesday

**Today's Progress** Good day, and welcome to day twelve. Was sick today; didn't do the day job. Wanted to stay in bed. Tooth broke, though, so I had to hit the dentist :-( boo. I was kind of awake after that so I ended up doing some coding. I slapped together a landing page for a sort of "family/team" domain I have w/ my wife, and added a view source page to my shiny new personal NuxtJS website rebuild that I launched recently. I want to do an obligatory "how I redid my blog" post w/ info on what/how/why I did things the way I did. Anyways. Good to dust this off again, again, again for the upmteenth time...

### Day 13: 24 February 2021, Wednesday

**Today's Progress** worked on getting my wife's website back online with some basic NuxtJS Content module boilerplate. Went down a rabbit hole w/ Stylelint in WSL/PHPStorm.

**Thoughts** Rabbit holes are a time suck. It's 10 already?!

### Day 14: 25 February 2021, Thursday

**Today's Progress** More main styles, & started state & some dynamic stuff for wife's website re-re-rebuild on NuxtJS.

**Thoughts** Learning Tailwind CSS was a good thing. Learning how to rip it out and replace it w/ real CSS has also been a good thing.

### Day 15: 26 February 2021, Friday

**Today's Progress** More style & store work on the wife site. Got menus loading out of content into the menus store. Issues w/ routes. May have a solution.

**Thoughts** Lots of these out of the box solutions make _everything soooo easy_ until you need something _slightly_ custom.

### Day 16: 27 February 2021, Saturday

**Today's Progress** Fixed issue w/ the menus not appearing everywhere w/ middleware.

### Day 17: 28 February 2021, Sunday

**Today's Progress** Fixed some of the nav issues on the wife's site.

### Day 18: 1 March 2021, Monday

**Today's Progress** Course work. Back to looking at [Adam Wathan's](https://adamwathan.me) [Advanced Vue Component Design](https://adamwathan.me/advanced-vue-component-design/).

**Thoughts** I completely did not understand half of it the first time I slogged through it. This time, it's clicking. I have a massive use-case for a renderless component. I re-did several chapters in that area of the course. A couple more an I'm going to tackle my implementation.

**Link(s) to work Nothing to link to today. Just me noodling around locally w/ Vue cli serve.**

### Day 19: 2 March 2021, Tuesday

**Today's Progress** Finished up all the dynamic stuff + responsive menus and things for Mrs. Harrington's website. I have to slap her updated content in there.

**Thoughts** This one has sat in various stages of "almost done" for a long time now. Feels good to get it out the door. Hosting it on Netlify.

Link(s) to work:

1. [Fn00b.com](https://fn00b.com) - again, updated content coming soon. But if you're interested in cyber security, check it out.

### Day 20: 3 March 2021, Wednesday

**Today's Progress** Started on an Advanced CSS Course on Udemy. Got through several sections including the part about CSS internals that was massively useful.

**Thoughts** Again, like when I did the Beginning JavaScript course, this is stuff I wish I'd known 20 years ago. Hell, even 5. The course dives into a lot of animations and transitions, which is all stuff I've never really touched, but I'm getting comfortable with it through repetition.

Link(s) to work:

I've been committing my work as I follow along in a [new repo here](https://gitlab.com/phillipsharring/advanced-css-course). I accidentally commited my node_modules folder (whoops!) so I won't link to the latest commit (don't click it!) - but you can check out the repo.

### Day 21: 4 March 2021, Thursday

**Today's Progress** Continued Advanced CSS Course. Got through several more sections. Learned a ton of stuff. Head is exploding.

**Thoughts** So jazzed and excited to learn all this stuff. Makes me really feel a million times more confident w/ CSS stuff.

### Day 22: 5 March 2021, Friday

**Today's Progress** Continued Advanced CSS Course, which is [here](https://www.udemy.com/share/101WkwCUUccF9U/) by the way. Tried out some hover animation stuff on the nav in my [own website](https://phillipharrington.com)

**Thoughts** The more I learn, the more I want to learn.

Link(s) to work:

1. [The last few commits here](https://gitlab.com/phillipsharring/phillipharrington.com/-/commits/main) cover the work on the menu, but you should probably just read the [resulting file around line 131](https://gitlab.com/phillipsharring/phillipharrington.com/-/blob/005b0afcc80d281149e7be572ad3690db4df95f2/components/layout/nav/main-menu.vue#L131).

### Day 23: 6 March 2021, Saturday

**Today's Progress**

Did a little bit more on the Advanced CSS Course, didn't push anything.

**Thoughts** Most of the day taken up w/ house hunting. Riding around in a car all over 2 counties is pretty exhausting, it turns out! :)

### Day 24: 7 March 2021, Sunday

**Today's Progress** This [beginning JavaScript](https://wellpaidgeek.teachable.com/) course was on sale, so I figured what the heck. Made some progress on it. Nothing new, yet, just a refresher, but that's good. Looking forward to the part about Promises, as I still need to grok them better. Need to start a repo for my work and I'll start linking it.

_And_ I got back to working on the side hustle proprietary thing. I'd been making more progress, but hadn't touched it for a couple of weeks. Came back to find it mysteriously in shambles. Got frustrated and went to bed. No links again, today, sorry.

**Thoughts** Why did that happen? Probably something in not having logged out/logged back in and/or stopped/restarted the dev server in a while and I screwed up some routing thing that wasn't detected until a restart? Maybe? Seems unlikely - but _something_ happened :) Which is weird because, "Code doesn't rust."

### Day 25: 8 March 2021, Monday

**Today's Progress** Day job, obvs. At night, started a fresh project for the side hustle front-end piece and simply moved stuff from the old back into the new. Using VS Code, ESLint & Prettier as a build module this time so there's no surprises. 2 extra spaces? Won't build! Strict but I recommend it. Also removing the heavy Tailwind CSS usage in favor of using what I'm learning in the Advanced CSS Course :D. No links again, sorry. I'll link some stuff up tomorrow.

**Thoughts** Clean code is clean. Ripping out Tailwind CSS from a 3rd project is nice, actually. I'm happier using SASS. And the build on Nuxt is _way, way, way_ faster without it. Maybe the 2.15 postcss 8 stuff will fix that, but it's not quite here yet.

### Day 26: 9 March 2021, Tuesday

**Today's Progress** Worked on the fresh-start of the side hustle. Moved it along. That's about it.

**Thoughts** I want to stop rebuilding the parts that have been built 3 times and finish the parts that have never been done. That is all. No links today. I'll get the open source stuff up soon.

### Day 27: 10 March 2021, Wednesday

**Today's Progress** Worked more on the fresh-start of the side hustle - it's almost back to where it was before it mysteriously broke, but this time w/ better Vuex store code since I figured out a bunch of stuff working on other stuff in the meantime.

**Thoughts** Other stuff like yet another course I took in the meantime which I haven't mentioned: [Nuxt.js - Vue.js on Steroids](https://www.udemy.com/share/102092CUUccF9U/) Check it out!

Link(s) to work: Can't share the side hustle stuff, of course, but I did publish the repo I've been doing the work for the JS in - enjoy:
