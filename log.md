# 100 Days Of Code - Log

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: 10 December 2019, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I figured out what was wonky w/ the route model binding in API routes. I fleshed out some basic endpoints for the orgs. There's index, store, show & update now. I also debugged and finished the add-employee endpoint.

**Thoughts** I didn't realize Route::bind _doesn't work at all_ w/o the SubstituteBindings middleware. My band unexpectedly kicked me out, so maybe this is a good time to have 100 days of code in my life, too :) Going to try and figure out if there's any way I can share code from what I'm working on when it's the proprietary hustle thing.
